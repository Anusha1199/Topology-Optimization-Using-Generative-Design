# Topology-Optimization-Using-Generative-Design
Project Overview
This project focuses on applying Topology Optimization using Generative Design methods to redesign an aerospace fin (control surface) for material efficiency, cost reduction, and structural performance enhancement.

The fin was modeled in SolidWorks, simulated for stress/strain behavior, and optimized using ANSYS and Netfabb. Both static and non-linear Finite Element Method (FEM) analyses were conducted to validate that strength and deformation characteristics remain unchanged post-optimization.

🧠 Project Objectives
🔩 Reduce weight and material cost of aerospace fin using topology optimization.

🛩️ Maintain aerodynamic and structural integrity under a 15kN aerodynamic load.

⚙️ Apply Generative Design techniques to arrive at an efficient and manufacturable design.

📉 Achieve cost savings without changing materials or requiring major documentation updates.
